## Premise :rocket:

B-branch is a tool that enhances Git branch management with a convenient git alias. Inspired by the talk [So You Think You Know Git? by Scott Chacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY&t=472s), B-branch offers a more organized view of your branches, simplifying your workflow.

Traditional git branch commands sort branches alphabetically, making it hard to find recent ones. B-branch solves this by displaying branch information like the last commit date and commit differences with the upstream branch, all in a structured format.

Cross-Platform Support: B-branch runs on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS** with no dependencies required when using the compiled executable. [Download](#download-computer) the latest release for **free**!

**key benefits**

- Quickly identify the branch you need.
- Access additional branch details not available with git branch.
- Enjoy reliable, high-performance, cross-platform support.

### Features

- **Branch information**: Displays the branch name, the date of the last commit, the number of commits ahead or behind the upstream branch, and the branch description.

- **Branch description**: Git offers the ability to add a description to a branch. B-branch displays this description in the output.

- **Pager interface**: If the output is too large to fit on the screen, the output will be displayed in a pager interface. While in the pager interface.
  - `q`: Quit the pager interface.
  - `j` OR `Down Arrow`: Move down one line.
  - `k` OR `Up Arrow`: Move up one line.
  - `f` OR `Space`: Move down one page.
  - `b`: Move up one page.
  - `g` OR `HOME`: Move to the top of the output.
  - `G` OR `END`: Move to the bottom of the output.
  - `/`: Search for a string in the output.
  - `Escape`: Clear the search.

### Example

Let's say you have a git repository with a lot of branches. You want to remove the branches that are no longer needed.

```sh
git bb --no-contains "main;development" -q \
| awk '{print substr($0, 3)}' \
| xargs -I {} git branch -D {}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command will delete all branches that do not contain the strings "main" or "development". Be careful when using this command.

---

The ability to see the branch description is also a feature that is not available in the standard `git branch` command. To add a description to a branch, use the following command:

```sh
git branch --edit-description
```

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that the description is stored in the `.git/EDIT_DESCRIPTION` and does not support a description on multiple branches.

## Usage

```sh
git bb [<options>] [<additional arguments>]
```

## FQAs

- **Q**: How do I add a description to a branch?
  - **A**: Use the following command: `git branch --edit-description`

- **Q**: Can I use this instead of the standard `git branch` command?
  - **A**: B-branch only helps developers view branch information. It does not replace the standard `git branch` command.

- **Q**: Will B-branch slow down git?
  - **A**: No, the extension works with an alias and does not affect the performance of git.

- **Q**: What is a common use case for B-branch?
  - **A**: A common use case I use is to check how many commits I am behind or ahead of the upstream main branch. To see if I need to pull or merge the changes. This can be done by running `git bb -t "origin/main"`.
